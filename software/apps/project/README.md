Indoor Environmental Monitoring Station
===============

## Overview
In this project, we develop a system to monitor various metrics in an indoor environment. We aims to sense indoor temperature, moisture, and carbon dioxide, and then use those data to ajust the indoor environment, which is more suitable for people to live in. 

## Hardware
In this project, we use Micro::bit as the core controller board. We use BME680, SGP30 sensors to measure the temperature, moisture, and carbon dioxide metrics, and then use OLED to display those data.

## Result
